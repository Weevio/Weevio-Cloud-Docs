# Line Items Management

Line items represent individual products or parts added to an order. Each line item contains product details, pricing, quantities, and inventory information. This guide covers how to add, edit, and manage line items in your orders.

## Overview

### What are Line Items?

Line items are the individual products or parts within an order. Each line item includes:

- **Part Number**: Unique identifier for the product
- **Description**: Product name and details
- **Quantity**: Amount ordered
- **Shipped Quantity**: Amount fulfilled
- **Price**: Unit and extended pricing
- **Stock Information**: Available inventory
- **Backorder Status**: Items on backorder

### Line Item Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Line #** | Sequential line number (auto-assigned) |
| **Part / Search** | Part number entry field with inventory search |
| **Description** | Product name and description (editable) |
| **Quantity** | Amount ordered |
| **Shipped** | Amount fulfilled/shipped |
| **Stock** | On-hand quantity at current location |
| **Backorder** | Items on backorder (appears as gray badge) |
| **Discount** | Price code/discount link (when applicable) |
| **No Tax** | Tax exemption toggle |
| **Price** | Unit price |
| **Extended** | Total price (Quantity × Price) |
| **Actions** | Line item menu (serial numbers, delete) |

## Adding Line Items

### Method 1: Manual Part Number Entry

<Step>
</Step>

<Note type="tip">
**Quick Tip**: The part number field is case-insensitive. "ABC123" and "abc123" will find the same part.
</Note>

### Method 2: Scanning Part Codes

<Step>
</Step>

### Method 3: Searching Inventory

<Step>
</Step>

<Note type="info">
**Search Behavior**: The search automatically excludes discontinued parts unless they have stock available. This prevents adding parts that cannot be fulfilled.
</Note>

### Method 4: Manual Entry Without Part Number

You can add line items without a part number for custom or one-off items:

<Step>
</Step>

<Note type="warning">
**Important**: Line items without part numbers:
- Do not adjust inventory
- Do not check stock availability
- Cannot have serial numbers assigned
- May require manual tax calculation
</Note>

## Editing Line Items

### Changing Quantities

<Step>
</Step>

### Changing Shipped Quantities

For Sales Orders and Invoices, you can adjust how many items are fulfilled:

<Step>
</Step>

<Note type="warning">
**Validation Rules**:
- Shipped quantity cannot exceed ordered quantity
- For items requiring inventory adjustment, shipped quantity cannot exceed available stock
- The system shows an inventory mismatch modal if you try to ship more than available
</Note>

### Editing Descriptions

<Step>
</Step>

### Applying Discounts

When a part has available price codes, a discount link appears in the **Discount** column:

<Step>
</Step>

<Note type="info">
**Price Code Inheritance**: If a customer has a default price code, it's automatically applied to new line items. You can override it with a different code using the discount link.
</Note>

### Toggling Tax Status

<Step>
</Step>

## Inventory Integration

### Stock Quantity Display

The **Stock** column shows the on-hand quantity at your current location. This updates in real-time when:

- Adding a new part
- Changing locations
- After other orders are processed

<Note type="info">
**Stock Display Rules**:
- Shows actual on-hand quantity for inventory-tracked parts
- Shows 0 for parts marked "Do Not Adjust On-Hand"
- Refreshes when you reload the order
</Note>

### Inventory Mismatch Handling

When you try to ship more items than available stock, the system displays an **Inventory Mismatch** modal:

<Step>
</Step>

**Example Scenario**:
- Customer orders 10 units (Quantity: 10)
- You have 6 in stock (Stock: 6)
- System calculates: 4 units not stocked

**Solution**:
- Set Shipped: 6
- Set Backorder: 4
- Quantity remains: 10
- Click Continue

### Stock Update Modal

When converting an order (e.g., Quote to Sales Order), you may see the **Update from Stock** modal:

<Step>
</Step>

<Note type="tip">
**Recommended**: Use "Yes" when converting quotes to orders, then manually adjust any lines that need special handling. This ensures shipped quantities reflect current inventory.
</Note>

### Multiple Location Support

If you switch locations while editing an order:

- Stock quantities refresh for the new location
- Previously loaded parts show updated on-hand amounts
- The system validates quantities against the new location's inventory

<Step>
</Step>

## Line Item Actions

### Removing Line Items

<Step>
</Step>

<Note type="warning">
**Important**: Deleting a line item:
- Cannot be undone
- Removes associated serial numbers
- Deletes auto-loaded AppleCare coverage (if applicable)
- Updates inventory allocations immediately
</Note>

### Managing Serial Numbers

For parts that require serial number tracking, the Actions menu includes a **Serials** option.

<Step>
</Step>

<Note type="info">
**When Serials Appear**: The Serials option only appears for:
- Parts marked as requiring serial numbers in inventory
- Sales Orders and Invoices (not Worksheets or Quotes)
- Lines with a shipped quantity greater than 0
</Note>

### AppleCare Management

For Apple products eligible for AppleCare, the Actions menu includes an **AppleCare** option.

<Step>
</Step>

## Understanding Line Item Fields

### Part Number vs Description

- **Part Number**: Immutable once saved. Must match an inventory record (unless blank).
- **Product Name/Description**: Editable even after loading from inventory. Use for custom notes or variations.

### Price Fields

**Unit Price**:
- Loaded from inventory record
- Can be overridden with price codes
- Editable only for line items without a part number

**Extended Price**:
- Automatically calculated as Quantity × Unit Price
- Updates in real-time when quantity or price changes
- Shown in bold in the Extended column

### Quantity vs Shipped

**Quantity**: Total amount ordered by the customer

**Shipped**: Amount being fulfilled in this transaction

**Backorder**: Calculated as Quantity - Shipped (shown in Backorder column)

**Worksheet/Quote Behavior**: Shipped always equals Quantity (no backorders)

**Sales Order/Invoice Behavior**: Shipped can be less than Quantity, creating backorders

### Cost vs Price

- **Cost**: Your cost from vendor (not visible in line item table)
- **Price**: Selling price to customer (visible in Price column)
- **List Price**: MSRP or retail price (stored but not displayed)

## Validation and Error Handling

### Common Validation Errors

#### "Part not found"

**Cause**: The part number doesn't exist in inventory at your current location.

**Solution**:
- Double-check the part code spelling
- Verify the part exists in your location's inventory
- Use the inventory search modal to browse available parts
- Add the part to inventory first if it's a new item

#### "Inventory Mismatch"

**Cause**: Trying to ship more items than available in stock.

**Solution**:
- Use the Inventory Mismatch modal to balance shipped and backorder quantities
- Reduce the shipped quantity to match available stock
- Increase backorder quantity to account for the shortage
- Verify stock levels in the inventory module

#### "Shipped quantity exceeds ordered quantity"

**Cause**: The number in the Shipped field is greater than the Quantity field.

**Solution**:
- Reduce shipped quantity to match or be less than the ordered quantity
- Increase the ordered quantity if the customer wants more items
- Check for data entry errors

#### "Empty value cannot be updated"

**Cause**: Attempting to save a line with blank required fields.

**Solution**:
- Enter a quantity value (cannot be blank)
- For custom items, ensure description and price are filled in
- Use 0 for shipped if no items are being fulfilled yet

#### "AppleCare parts can't be modified"

**Cause**: Trying to edit an auto-loaded AppleCare line item.

**Solution**:
- AppleCare lines are auto-generated and protected from editing
- Modify the parent device line item instead
- Use the AppleCare action menu to adjust coverage
- Delete and re-add the parent item if major changes are needed

### Error Recovery

## Special Line Item Types

### AppleCare Products

AppleCare line items are automatically added when you configure coverage for eligible devices:

**Characteristics**:
- Cannot be manually edited (quantity, price, description locked)
- Linked to a parent device line item
- Automatically deleted if parent device is removed
- Show "AppleCare parts can't be modified" tooltip when clicked

**Management**: Use the AppleCare action menu on the parent device to modify coverage.

### Parts Not in Inventory

Line items without a part number:

**Characteristics**:
- Price field becomes editable
- No stock quantity shown
- No inventory adjustments occur
- Cannot have serial numbers
- Useful for services, one-time items, or special orders

**Best Practice**: Add a detailed description since there's no inventory record to reference.

### Discontinued Parts with Stock

Discontinued parts appear in search results only if stock is available:

**Characteristics**:
- Can be added to orders while stock lasts
- Stock quantity is accurate
- May have limited or no pricing information
- Description may indicate "Discontinued"

**Recommendation**: Notify customers that the part is discontinued and may not be available for future orders.

## Keyboard Shortcuts and Quick Actions

### Navigation

- **Tab**: Move to next field (and trigger save for quantities)
- **Shift+Tab**: Move to previous field
- **Enter**: Load part number (in Part field only)
- **Escape**: Close search modal

### Quick Entry Workflow

For fast order entry, use this pattern:

1. Click Part Number field
2. Type or scan part code
3. Press **Enter** to load
4. Press **Tab** (quantity defaults to 1)
5. Press **Tab** (accept default shipped)
6. Repeat for next line

### Field Auto-Selection

When you click in quantity, shipped, or price fields, the entire value is automatically selected. This allows you to:

- Type a new value to replace the old one completely
- Press Delete to clear the field
- Start typing immediately without selecting text first

## Troubleshooting

### Line Item Won't Save

**Check these items**:
- Is the order in a saved state? (Check for ORDER_NUMBER)
- Are you on a line marked as "Auto Load"?
- Is the order type editable? (Voided and Posted orders cannot be edited)
- Do you have the correct permissions?

### Stock Quantity Not Updating

**Try these steps**:
1. Refresh the order to reload inventory data
2. Verify the correct location is selected
3. Check if the part is marked "Do Not Adjust On-Hand"
4. Confirm inventory was updated in the inventory module

### Price Not Applying Correctly

**Verify**:
- Is a price code applied? (Check Discount column)
- Does the customer have a default price code?
- Is the price code still valid? (Check date range)
- Has the inventory record's price been updated?

### Search Modal Not Finding Parts

**Common causes**:
- Part doesn't exist at your current location
- Part is discontinued with zero stock
- Search terms don't match any indexed fields
- Inventory cache needs refresh

**Solution**: Try searching by part code directly, or check the inventory module to verify the part exists.

## Best Practices

### Order Entry Efficiency

1. **Use Tab Navigation**: Keep your hands on the keyboard by using Tab to move between fields.

2. **Leverage Search**: When unsure of exact part codes, use the search modal with partial terms.

3. **Batch Similar Items**: Add all line items before adjusting quantities or prices.

4. **Review Stock First**: For large orders, check stock availability in the inventory module before creating the order.

5. **Save Frequently**: The system auto-saves line items, but major changes trigger saves. Don't rely on manual save buttons.

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

1. **Don't Mix Up Quantity and Shipped**: For Sales Orders/Invoices, these are different fields. Quantity is ordered, Shipped is fulfilled.

2. **Check Location First**: Ensure you're in the correct location before adding parts. Stock quantities are location-specific.

3. **Verify Part Numbers**: Small typos in part codes can load the wrong item. Always verify the product name after loading.

4. **Use Price Codes Properly**: Apply price codes before finalizing quantities to ensure correct pricing.

5. **Note Serial Requirements**: Check if parts require serial numbers before setting shipped quantities. You'll need to assign serials before finalizing.

### Data Quality

1. **Maintain Clean Descriptions**: Even though descriptions are editable, keep them clear and consistent.

2. **Document Custom Items**: For line items without part numbers, include detailed descriptions for future reference.

3. **Track Backorders**: Use the backorder quantity to maintain accurate fulfillment records.

4. **Review Before Finalizing**: Double-check quantities, prices, and stock availability before converting to invoices.
