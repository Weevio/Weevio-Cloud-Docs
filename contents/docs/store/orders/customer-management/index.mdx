# Customer Management

Customer information is essential for processing orders in Weevio Store. This guide covers how to select customers, manage billing and shipping addresses, and handle various customer scenarios.

## Overview

Every order in Weevio can be associated with a customer from your PIMS database. Customer information includes:

- **Billing details**: Contact person, billing address, email, and phone
- **Shipping details**: Shipping address and contact information
- **Customer history**: Payment terms, pricing, and purchase history
- **Multiple shipping locations**: Alternative delivery addresses

When a customer is linked to an order, their information automatically populates billing and shipping fields, making order entry faster and more accurate.

## Selecting Customers

### Using Customer Search

The primary way to add a customer to an order is through the customer search feature:

1. **Access Search**: In the Customer Billing or Customer Shipping tab, click the **Search** button next to the "Name / Search" field
2. **Enter Search Terms**: Type any of the following:
   - Customer code (e.g., "CUST001")
   - Customer name (billing or shipping)
   - Email address (billing or shipping)
   - First or last name
   - Phone number
3. **Select Customer**: Click on a customer from the search results to link them to the order

<Callout type="info">
The search is case-insensitive and searches across multiple fields simultaneously. You can type partial information to find customers.
</Callout>

### Customer Search Fields

The customer search modal displays the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Customer Code | Unique identifier from PIMS |
| Billing Name | Company or customer name |
| Billing Email | Primary email address |
| Billing Phone | Primary phone number |
| Business | Indicates if this is a business account |

**Screenshot Placeholder**: Customer Search Modal showing search results

### Quick Search via Name Field

You can also trigger customer search automatically:

1. Type a customer name, email, or code directly into the **Name / Search** field
2. When the field loses focus (on blur), if no customer is linked yet, the search modal opens automatically
3. The search modal pre-populates with your entered text

This shortcut saves time when you know part of the customer's information.

## Customer Information Display

### Customer Billing Tab

The Customer Billing tab displays and allows editing of:

<Tabs items={['Fields', 'Layout']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Contact Information**:
    - ATTN (Attention/Contact Person)
    - Email
    - Phone 1
    - Phone 2 (for SROs) or Fax (for Orders)

    **Billing Address**:
    - Address 1 (with USPS validation button)
    - Address 2
    - City
    - State
    - Postal Code
    - Country
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The billing tab uses a two-column layout:

    - **Left column**: Name/search field and contact details
    - **Right column**: Address fields with validation

    All fields update in real-time as you type and save automatically when you tab to the next field (for saved orders).
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Customer Shipping Tab

The Customer Shipping tab mirrors the billing structure but focuses on delivery details:

- **Shipping Name**: Company or recipient name
- **ATTN**: Delivery contact person (for business addresses)
- **Shipping Address**: Complete delivery address with USPS validation
- **Shipping Contact**: Email and phone for delivery coordination

<Callout type="tip">
For individual customers (not businesses), the ATTN field is automatically hidden in the shipping tab.
</Callout>

## Billing Information

### Editing Billing Details

To modify billing information:

1. Navigate to the **Customer Billing** tab
2. Click into any field to edit
3. Make your changes
4. Tab to the next field or click elsewhere to save

**Field Behaviors**:

- **ATTN (Attention)**: Contact person at the billing address
- **Name**: Automatically populated from `BNAME` or `CUSTOMER_NAME`
- **Email**: Primary contact email (used for invoices and receipts)
- **Phone 1**: Primary phone number (automatically formatted)
- **Phone 2/Fax**: Secondary contact number

<Callout type="warning">
Changes to billing information on a saved order update PIMS immediately. For unsaved orders, changes are held locally until the order is created.
</Callout>

### Billing Address Validation

Weevio includes USPS address validation:

1. Enter or modify an address in the billing fields
2. Click the **Validate Address** button next to Address 1
3. The system validates the address against USPS database
4. If validated successfully:
   - Address fields update to standardized format
   - Notifications appear for business addresses or vacant properties
   - Order is automatically saved (if it has an order number)

**Validation Messages**:
- "According to the USPS, this is a business address."
- "According to the USPS, this address is vacant."

### Required Billing Fields

While Weevio allows flexible data entry, certain fields improve order processing:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Name | Recommended | Used for invoices and shipping labels |
| Email | Recommended | Required for digital receipts |
| Phone 1 | Optional | Helpful for delivery coordination |
| Address 1 | Required for shipping | Must be validated for ship orders |
| City | Required for shipping | Part of complete address |
| State | Required for shipping | Used for tax calculations |
| Postal Code | Required for shipping | Enables accurate shipping costs |

## Shipping Information

### Using Billing Address for Shipping

By default, shipping information mirrors billing information when you first link a customer. To keep them synchronized:

1. Make changes in the **Customer Billing** tab
2. The shipping fields automatically reflect customer defaults from PIMS
3. To override, switch to **Customer Shipping** tab and make changes

### Separate Shipping Address

To use a different shipping address:

1. Navigate to the **Customer Shipping** tab
2. Modify any shipping field as needed
3. Changes save automatically when the field loses focus

**Common Scenarios**:
- Shipping to a different office or warehouse
- Delivering to a customer's home vs. business
- Special event or temporary location delivery

### Using Shipping Locations

Many customers have multiple pre-configured shipping locations in PIMS:

1. Click the **Locations** button (map marker icon) in the order header
2. The Shipping Locations modal displays all additional addresses for this customer
3. Click on any location to apply it to the current order
4. The shipping tab updates with the selected location's details

**Shipping Locations Display**:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Location identifier |
| Address 1 | Primary street address |
| City | City name |
| Zipcode | Postal code |
| Phone | Contact number for this location |

**Screenshot Placeholder**: Shipping Locations modal showing multiple addresses

### Reverting to Primary Shipping Address

If you've selected an alternate shipping location and want to revert:

1. Open the **Locations** modal
2. Click the **Use Primary Shipping Address** button at the bottom
3. Shipping fields reset to the customer's default PIMS shipping address

<Callout type="info">
The system tracks whether you're using an alternate location with the `usingAShippingLocation` flag. This ensures proper order processing and shipping label generation.
</Callout>

### Shipping Contact Details

For shipping addresses, you can specify:

- **ATTN**: Person receiving the shipment (shown only for business addresses)
- **Email**: Delivery notification email
- **Phone**: Contact number for delivery issues
- **Phone 2** (SROs): Secondary contact

These details help carriers coordinate delivery and notify recipients.

## Customer Sync & Validation

### Syncing with PIMS

When you link a customer to an order, Weevio performs several synchronization steps:

1. **Fetch Customer Data**: Retrieves complete customer record from PIMS
2. **Update Order Fields**: Populates billing and shipping information
3. **Sync Line Items**: Updates pricing, discounts, and AppleCare based on customer
4. **Recalculate Totals**: Applies customer-specific pricing and tax rules

<Callout type="tip">
Customer sync only occurs when an order has been saved (has an ORDER_NUMBER). For new unsaved orders, customer data is applied locally without PIMS updates.
</Callout>

### Customer Refetch

If customer information changes in PIMS while you're editing an order:

1. Another user updates customer details in PIMS
2. Weevio detects the change via localStorage events
3. The system automatically refetches customer data
4. Your order updates with the latest information

This cross-window synchronization ensures data consistency.

### Unlinking Customers

To remove a customer from an order:

1. Click the **Unlink** button (yellow) next to the Search button
2. Confirm the action
3. All customer fields clear to blank values
4. If the order is saved, PIMS is updated to remove the customer link

**What happens when unlinking**:
- `CUSTOMER_CODE` is cleared
- All billing and shipping fields reset to empty
- Purchase Order Number and Reference Number clear
- Salesperson Code is preserved

<Callout type="warning">
Unlinking a customer cannot be undone. You'll need to search and re-link the customer if needed.
</Callout>

### Replacing Customers

If you need to change which customer is linked to an order:

1. Search for and select a different customer
2. Weevio displays a confirmation modal showing:
   - Current customer information
   - New customer you're selecting
3. Choose **Replace** to confirm
4. The system updates the order with new customer data
5. Line items re-sync with new customer pricing

## Validation Rules

### Address Validation

USPS address validation performs the following checks:

- **Standardization**: Converts addresses to USPS standard format
- **Business Detection**: Identifies commercial addresses
- **Vacancy Check**: Flags vacant properties
- **Deliverability**: Verifies address can receive mail

**Validation Triggers**:
- Clicking the validation button next to Address 1
- Automatic validation on blur (for some implementations)

### Field-Level Validation

Weevio performs automatic validation on customer fields:

- **Email**: Must be valid email format (username@domain.com)
- **Phone**: Automatically formatted (e.g., (555) 555-5555)
- **Postal Code**: Must match country format

### Required Fields

For different order types, certain fields are required:

**Quotes and Worksheets**:
- Customer Name (optional)
- Minimal address information

**Sales Orders**:
- Customer Code (recommended)
- Billing Name
- Billing Email

**Invoices**:
- Customer Code (required for PIMS integration)
- Complete billing address
- Complete shipping address (if different)
- Valid email for digital receipts

## Special Cases

### Walk-in Customers

For customers without PIMS records:

1. Leave the customer search empty
2. Manually enter billing and shipping information
3. Create the order without linking a customer
4. The order saves with entered information only

**Limitations**:
- No automatic pricing or discounts
- No customer history tracking
- Manual entry required for each order

<Callout type="tip">
For frequent walk-in customers, create a PIMS customer record in the POS Customers module. This enables better tracking and reporting.
</Callout>

### Guest Checkout

Guest checkout is similar to walk-in:

1. Enter minimal customer information
2. Focus on shipping address accuracy
3. Collect email for order confirmation
4. Skip customer code entry

### Multiple Shipping Locations

For customers with many shipping locations:

1. Link the customer first
2. Open the **Locations** modal
3. Use the filter/search to find specific location
4. Select the appropriate shipping address

**Tips for Multiple Locations**:
- Locations are named descriptively (e.g., "Main Warehouse", "Retail Store")
- Search by city, zipcode, or location name
- The modal shows up to 2,500 locations
- Use consistent naming in PIMS for easier searching

### International Addresses

For customers outside the United States:

1. Enter billing/shipping information as normal
2. **Country field**: Specify the country name
3. **State field**: Use province or region as appropriate
4. **Postal Code**: Use format appropriate for the country
5. **USPS Validation**: Skip validation (only works for US addresses)

**International Field Tips**:
- Use full country names (e.g., "Canada" not "CA")
- State field accepts any text for international addresses
- Phone numbers: Include country code (e.g., "+1 (555) 555-5555")

### Business vs. Individual Customers

The system handles business and individual customers differently:

**Business Customers** (`BUSINESS_OR_INDIVIDUAL = true`):
- Display ATTN field in both billing and shipping tabs
- ATTN is the contact person name
- Name field is company name

**Individual Customers**:
- Hide ATTN field (in some views)
- Name field combines FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME
- Simpler contact information

### Updating Existing Customer Information

If you notice customer information is outdated while creating an order:

1. **For minor corrections**: Edit fields directly in the order
2. **For major updates**:
   - Navigate to POS > Customers
   - Search for the customer
   - Update their master record in PIMS
   - Return to your order
   - The system refetches updated data

<Callout type="info">
Changes made in an order update that specific order but may not update the customer's master record in PIMS. For permanent changes, edit the customer record directly.
</Callout>

## Viewing Customer Details

### Customer Button

Once a customer is linked to an order:

1. Look for the **Customer** button (user icon) in the order header
2. Click to open the customer's full profile in a new window
3. View complete customer history, notes, and details
4. The original order remains open in your current window

This allows you to reference customer information while building the order.

### Customer Code Display

The customer code appears in multiple places:

- **Order Header**: In the customer tabs area
- **Customer Search**: When searching for customers
- **Shipping Locations**: Associated with each location

Customer codes are unique identifiers in PIMS and should be used for accurate record-keeping.

## Troubleshooting

### Customer Search Returns No Results

**Problem**: Searching for a customer returns no results.

**Solutions**:
1. Try different search terms (name, email, customer code)
2. Check for typos or extra spaces
3. Verify the customer exists in PIMS
4. Try searching by partial information
5. Check if customer is in the correct organization/location

### Customer Information Won't Save

**Problem**: Edits to customer fields don't persist.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Order Status**: Ensure the order has been saved (has an ORDER_NUMBER)
2. **Check Editability**: Verify the order is not locked or paid
3. **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection to PIMS
4. **Field Focus**: Make sure to tab out of fields to trigger save
5. **Permissions**: Verify you have edit permissions for this order type

### Shipping Location Not Applying

**Problem**: Selecting a shipping location doesn't update the order.

**Solutions**:
1. Click the location row in the modal (don't just select it)
2. Wait for the modal to close before checking shipping tab
3. Refresh the order if changes don't appear
4. Verify the location has complete address information in PIMS

### Address Validation Fails

**Problem**: USPS validation returns an error or doesn't recognize the address.

**Solutions**:
1. **Rural Addresses**: Some rural routes may not validate
2. **New Construction**: Recent addresses may not be in USPS database yet
3. **Format Issues**: Try entering address without abbreviations
4. **PO Boxes**: Use standard format "PO Box 123"
5. **Manual Entry**: You can skip validation and enter manually if needed

### Customer Code Already Linked

**Problem**: Trying to link a customer but getting a warning.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if customer is already linked (look for customer code in fields)
2. Use **Unlink** button to remove current customer first
3. Use **Replace** option if prompted to confirm customer change
4. Verify you're working with the correct order

### Duplicate Customer Records

**Problem**: Search shows multiple entries for the same customer.

**Solutions**:
1. Check customer codes to identify the primary record
2. Use the most recent or most complete record
3. Note duplicate codes and report to PIMS administrator
4. Verify with customer which record is correct
5. In PIMS, merge duplicate customer records

### Missing Shipping Locations

**Problem**: Customer should have multiple locations but modal shows none.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify locations are set up in PIMS customer record
2. Check that locations are in the `CUSTOMERS_ADDITIONAL_LOCATIONS` sub-records
3. Ensure customer code is correct
4. Refresh the order and try again
5. Add missing locations in PIMS if needed

## Best Practices

### Customer Linking

1. **Link customers early**: Search and link customers before adding line items
2. **Verify customer**: Double-check customer name and code before proceeding
3. **Update information**: Correct any outdated customer details as you go
4. **Use customer codes**: When possible, search by customer code for accuracy

### Address Management

1. **Validate addresses**: Always use USPS validation for shipping orders
2. **Complete information**: Fill in all address fields, even optional ones
3. **Shipping locations**: Use pre-configured locations instead of manual entry
4. **International addresses**: Be extra careful with format and country codes

### Order Efficiency

1. **Batch similar orders**: Link the same customer across multiple orders
2. **Save frequently**: Save orders after linking customers to trigger sync
3. **Use keyboard**: Tab through fields instead of clicking for faster entry
4. **Shortcuts**: Use quick search by typing in name field

### Data Quality

1. **Consistent formatting**: Use same format for phone numbers, addresses
2. **Complete records**: Fill in email and phone even if not required
3. **Update PIMS**: Fix customer data in PIMS, not just in orders
4. **Report issues**: Note any data quality problems for administrator review
